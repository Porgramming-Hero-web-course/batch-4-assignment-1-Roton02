# The importance of Typescript's union and intersection types

Union and intersection types give TypeScript developers a high degree of flexibility while maintaining strong typing, making it easier to work with complex data structures and ensuring safer and more predictable code. These features significantly improve code quality by providing precise control over how different types are combined or allowed in different contexts.
In TypeScript, union and intersection types are used to compose or model types from existing types.

These new composed types behave differently, depending on whether they were composed through a union or intersection of the existing type they were formed from.

Defined in the Advanced Types section of Typescript, an intersection type is a type that combines several types into one; a value that can be any one of several types is a union type.

The & symbol is used to create an intersection, whereas the | symbol is used to represent a union. An intersection can be read as an And operator and a union as an Or.

## What kinds of unions are there?

A variable can store values of several designated types thanks to union. When you want a value to be one of multiple kinds instead of just one, it's useful. Here's an illustration:

- const result: number | string;

  "Success" is the result; // This one is legitimate.

  result = 42; // This is also true.

In this case, the outcome could be a number or a string.

## Why are union types significant?

It's helpful in situations when a variable may have different kinds depending on the situation.
More flexibility is offered without compromising type safety.

## What types of intersections are there?

Intersection types, on the other hand, let us merge multiple types into a single one, incorporating all the properties and methods from each type. This proves invaluable when dealing with object types and creating composite types from existing ones. Let’s illustrate this with an 


UserType = {name:string; email:string };

{ role: "admin"; 
permissions: string[]
 };

type AdminType = UserType & AdminType = type AdminUser;

AdminUser = { 
    name: "Roton", 
    email: "roton@gmail.com", 
    role: "admin",
     permissions: ["add","update"], 
    }; as const admin

In this case, the outcome could be a number or a string.

## What makes intersection types significant?

It facilitates the creation of complicated data types with properties shared by several types.
The ability to combine several necessary types with fewer code is provided.

## Benefits
Union and intersection types are not just fancy jargon; they’re essential tools for writing robust, maintainable code. By leveraging these features, we catch bugs early in the development process and make our code more adaptable and understandable. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting, mastering union and intersection types in TypeScript will undoubtedly elevate your programming prowess.
